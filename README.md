# Research Logbook

A simple yet powerful LaTeX template for research notebook with modular components and a wide variety of tools.

Note: When cloning this inside a project, move the `Images` folder and the `.bib` file to the root folder of the project and rename it to `img` such that it can be shared with other source files.

Also, if you have your `.bib` file somewhere else like your [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) folder you can run `setup_bib.sh <BibFilePath>` to link your `.bib` file located in `<BibfilePath>`.

Git `README.md` templates are added in `templates/`.
